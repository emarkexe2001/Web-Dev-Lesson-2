Bootstrap is.......

# Line breaks in html 

A line break is a seperation of text through the creation of a new line, we can use this to format text such as address lines to create a single text with a text on each new line.

We can accomplish this through the use of two different HTML tags

Break tag - Seperates the line where the tag is used - has no ending tags.

Pre tag - Keeps the formatting for the text exactly the same including line breaks and spaces.

# Break Tag (<br>) Example

```html
<html>
    <title>Welcome to Web Development Lesson 2</title>
    <body>
        <p>This<br>is<br>a<br>Line<br>Break<br>
    </body>
</html>
```

# Pre Tag (<pre>) Example

```html
<html>
    <title>Welcome to Web Development Lesson 2</title>
    <body>
        <pre>This is the pre tag              ,
             any information displayed in this tage
             preserves spaces and line breaks.
        </pre>
    </body>
</html>
```
